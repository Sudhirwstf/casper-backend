        "discovery_results": "Okay, I will find active and relevant Instagram accounts based on your content analysis parameters. Since you've provided a general framework without a specific topic or industry, I will use \"sustainability\" as a placeholder topic to demonstrate the search process. You can then adapt this approach to your specific content analysis needs.\n\n**FOUND INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS (Example using \"Sustainability\" as the topic):**\n\n**Note:** Follower counts are approximate and can change rapidly. I recommend checking the accounts directly on Instagram for the most up-to-date information. Also, due to the limitations of the search results, I am providing a selection of accounts. A more comprehensive search within Instagram itself would likely yield more results.\n\nüè¢ **ORGANIZATIONS/COMPANIES:**\n\n*   @ConservationOrg - International conservation organization providing beautiful content about wildlife, nature sites, and climate news. (Follower count: Varies, often in the millions)\n*   @Greenpeace - Environmental NGO campaigning on climate change, deforestation, overfishing, and more. (Follower count: Millions)\n*   @UNEP - United Nations Environment Programme, sharing updates and information on global environmental issues. (Follower count: Millions)\n*   @FutureEarth - A network of scientists dedicated to sustainability research, highlighting findings and solutions. (Follower count: Varies, often in the hundreds of thousands)\n*   @Seedandsproutco - Eco-friendly page for sustainable, reusable, plastic-free products. (Follower count: Varies, often in the hundreds of thousands)\n\nüë§ **INDIVIDUAL PROFESSIONALS:**\n\n*   @Aliceaedy - Climate justice documentary filmmaker and photographer. Founder of Earthrise Studio. (Follower count: Varies, often in the tens or hundreds of thousands)\n*   @Maxlamanna - Zero waste chef, sustainability advocate, and author sharing easy-to-cook recipes to reduce food waste. (Follower count: Varies, often in the tens or hundreds of thousands)\n*   @Venetialamanna - Broadcaster and ethical fashion campaigner, co-founder of Remember Who Made Them. (Follower count: Varies, often in the tens or hundreds of thousands)\n*   @Trashisfortossers - Lauren Singer, living a zero-waste lifestyle in NYC, sharing hacks and tips. (Follower count: Varies, often in the hundreds of thousands)\n*   @Mikaelaloach - Climate justice activist focusing on sustainability with inclusivity. (Follower count: Varies, often in the tens or hundreds of thousands)\n\nüì∞ **MEDIA/NEWS ACCOUNTS:**\n\n*   It's difficult to find accounts that are *strictly* news-focused on Instagram, as many news outlets use their general accounts to post about sustainability. However, some accounts aggregate climate news:\n*   @WaterfrontAlliance - Shares news and information about organizations supporting green causes. (Follower count: Varies, often in the tens of thousands)\n\nüéì **EDUCATIONAL/ACADEMIC:**\n\n*   It's challenging to find accounts that are *strictly* educational institutions on Instagram. However, individual academics and organizations often share educational content:\n*   @Intersectionalenvironmentalist - Educational account exploring how various identities link to environmentalism, run by Leah Thomas. (Follower count: Varies, often in the hundreds of thousands)\n\n**PLATFORM-SPECIFIC NOTES:**\n\n*   Instagram's algorithm prioritizes visual content, so accounts with high-quality photos and videos tend to perform better.\n*   Engagement is crucial. Look for accounts that actively respond to comments and foster a sense of community.\n*   Use relevant hashtags (e.g., #sustainability, #ecofriendly, #sustainableliving, #climateaction) to discover more accounts.\n*   Check the \"Recently Posted\" section to ensure accounts are active.\n*   Manually review accounts to assess their relevance to your specific content analysis.\n\nRemember to replace \"sustainability\" with your actual topic and industry for more targeted results. Good luck!\n",
