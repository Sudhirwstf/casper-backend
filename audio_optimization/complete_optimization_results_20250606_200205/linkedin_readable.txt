**Breaking Political News: The Escalating Feud Between Trump and Musk**

In a surprising turn of events, a rift has emerged between President Trump and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, marking a significant moment in the landscape of American politics. This breaking political news comes as the public exchange of insults on Thursday raises questions about the future of their once-strong alliance.

**What Sparked the Feud?**

The tension escalated following Musk's vocal criticism of Trump's recent tax and spending megabill, which includes a rollback of electric-vehicle tax credits—a move that directly impacts Musk's business interests in the technology sector, particularly at @tesla. This conflict highlights the intersection of politics and business, a recurring theme in the latest in US political news.

Trump responded by accusing Musk of suffering from "Trump derangement syndrome," asserting that Musk's opposition stems from self-interest rather than a commitment to the American people. He even hinted at the possibility of cutting government subsidies and contracts that benefit Musk's ventures, including @spacex, a move that could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry.

On the flip side, Musk, who played a pivotal role in Trump's election campaign, expressed his disappointment, claiming that Trump would not be in the Oval Office without his support. In a bold move, Musk suggested the formation of a third political party and echoed sentiments that Trump should face impeachment, further complicating the political landscape.

**The Fallout: Stock Market Reactions and Political Implications**

The fallout from this public feud has been significant. Tesla's stock experienced a dramatic 14% drop on Thursday, erasing approximately $152.4 billion in market value—the largest single-day decline in its history. However, shares rebounded slightly with a 4% increase in premarket trading on Friday, illustrating the market's sensitivity to political developments.

As the political landscape shifts, reactions from various stakeholders—including Democrats, Steve Bannon, and the broader social media community—have flooded in, highlighting the contentious nature of this feud. This situation serves as a case study in the trends and analysis of how political conflicts can ripple through the economy.

**Where Do We Go From Here?**

As of now, Trump has no intention of reconciling with Musk, according to senior White House sources. The president is even contemplating selling or giving away his Tesla, a move that underscores the depth of this rift and its implications for democracy and political alliances in America.
