      "discovery_results": "Okay, I will search for active and relevant Twitter/X.com accounts based on your content analysis and requirements. I will use the provided keywords, hashtags, and search queries to identify accounts related to the Trump-Musk feud, Tesla stock, SpaceX, third political party discussions, and NASA, focusing on accounts with recent activity, good engagement, and a substantial following.\n\nOkay, based on my research, here are some active and relevant Twitter/X.com accounts related to your content analysis, formatted as requested:\n\n**FOUND TWITTER/X.COM ACCOUNTS:**\n\nPlease note that follower counts are approximate and subject to change. Due to the nature of Twitter/X, identifying accounts *specifically* interested in the *feud* aspect is challenging, so I've focused on accounts covering the related themes. Also, many prominent individuals and organizations have a presence, but their engagement levels on specific topics vary.\n\nüè¢ **ORGANIZATIONS/COMPANIES:**\n\n*   @SpaceX - Official SpaceX account (substantial follower count) - Provides updates on launches, missions, and company news.\n*   @NASA - Official NASA account (substantial follower count) - Shares news, images, and information about space exploration and scientific discoveries.\n*   @Tesla - Official Tesla account (substantial follower count) - Updates on company news, product releases, and the electric vehicle industry.\n*   @Commercial_Crew - NASA's Commercial Crew Program account (follower count varies) - Focuses on the partnership between NASA and private companies for crewed spaceflights.\n\nüë§ **INDIVIDUAL PROFESSIONALS:**\n\n*   @elonmusk - Elon Musk's personal account (substantial follower count) - Often tweets about Tesla, SpaceX, politics, and various other topics. (Note: Engagement varies depending on the topic).\n*   Accounts of Political Commentators/Analysts - It's difficult to pinpoint specific commentators *solely* focused on the Trump/Musk dynamic. Actively searching for political commentators who are currently posting about the feud would be a good approach.\n*   @SciGuySpace - Eric Berger, Senior Space Editor at Ars Technica (follower count varies) - Provides insights and analysis on the space industry, including SpaceX and NASA.\n*   @howellspace - Elizabeth Howell, Space Journalist (follower count varies) - Covers spaceflight and related topics.\n\nüì∞ **MEDIA/NEWS ACCOUNTS:**\n\n*   @SpaceDotcom - Space.com's official account (substantial follower count) - Shares space-related news, articles, and images.\n*   Major news outlets (e.g., @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @cnn, @foxnews) - While not exclusively focused on these topics, they will likely cover major developments in the Trump-Musk feud, its political implications, and impacts on Tesla and SpaceX.\n\nüéì **EDUCATIONAL/ACADEMIC:**\n\n*   It's less common to find *dedicated* academic accounts focused *solely* on these specific themes. However, searching for professors or researchers in political science, economics, or space policy who are actively tweeting could yield relevant results.\n\n**Platform-Specific Notes:**\n\n*   **X.com Advanced Search:** Utilize X.com's advanced search to filter by date, keywords, and engagement metrics (likes, retweets).\n*   **Boolean Operators:** Refine searches using \"AND,\" \"OR,\" and \"NOT\" to combine keywords effectively. For example, \"Tesla AND stock AND (analysis OR forecast)\"\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n*   **Lists:** Create private or public Twitter/X lists to organize and monitor relevant accounts.\n*   **Hashtag Monitoring:** Track relevant hashtags (e.g., #TrumpMuskFeud, #TeslaStock, #SpaceX) to discover emerging accounts and conversations.\n*   **Engagement as a Filter:** When you find potentially relevant accounts, check their recent tweets and engagement levels to ensure they are active and likely to be interested in your content analysis.\n\nI hope this is a helpful starting point for your content analysis!\n",
