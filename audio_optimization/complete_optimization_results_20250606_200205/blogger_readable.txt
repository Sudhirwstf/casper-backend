# Live Updates: Feud Between Trump and Elon Musk Escalates in Public View

**A Rift in the Political Landscape**

In a shocking turn of events, the relationship between President Donald Trump and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk has taken a dramatic nosedive. On Thursday, these two influential figures exchanged a series of insults, marking a significant rupture in what was once considered a pivotal alliance in modern American politics. This feud has captured the attention of both political analysts and the general public, intertwining the realms of politics, technology, and campaign dynamics.

**The Catalyst for Conflict**

Tensions flared after Musk publicly criticized Trump’s ambitious tax and spending megabill, which aims to reshape the economic landscape. Musk, who recently stepped down from his role as the president’s cost-cutting czar, voiced his discontent over the bill's proposed rollback of electric vehicle tax credits—an issue that directly impacts his business interests and the broader technology sector.

### What Trump Said

In response, President Trump did not hold back. He accused Musk of suffering from “Trump derangement syndrome,” suggesting that the billionaire’s opposition to the megabill was rooted in personal grievances rather than sound policy. Trump further threatened to cut government subsidies and contracts that benefit Musk’s various enterprises, a statement that could have significant repercussions for the future of Musk's ventures and the electric vehicle market.

### Musk's Retort

Elon Musk, who invested hundreds of millions to support Trump’s election campaign, fired back, claiming the president was ungrateful and implying that Trump would not have reached the Oval Office without his backing @politico. In a surprising twist, Musk hinted at the possibility of launching a third political party and even agreed with sentiments circulating on social media that Trump should face impeachment.

Adding fuel to the fire, Musk threatened to decommission SpaceX’s Dragon vehicle, which NASA relies on for missions to the International Space Station. However, he later retracted this statement, leaving many to speculate about the seriousness of his threats and the potential impact on future space technology initiatives.

Musk also made a controversial claim regarding Trump’s name appearing in files associated with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, suggesting that this connection is why certain documents have yet to be released. This allegation has sparked further debate in the political news arena.

### Reactions from the Political Arena

The fallout from this feud has not gone unnoticed. Political commentators, including Democrats and former Trump advisor Steve Bannon, quickly weighed in on the escalating situation. The social media universe buzzed with reactions, showcasing the public's keen interest in this high-profile clash and its implications for democracy and political discourse.

### Market Impact: Tesla's Stock Reaction

The feud has had immediate financial implications as well. Shares of Tesla, Musk’s electric vehicle company, plummeted by 14% on Thursday, resulting in a staggering loss of approximately $152.4 billion in market value—the largest single-day decline in the company’s history @realclearpolitics. However, there was a slight recovery, with shares rising by 4% in premarket trading on Friday, reflecting the volatile nature of the market and investor sentiment amid breaking political news.

### Where Things Stand Now

As the dust settles, it appears that President Trump has no intention of reaching out to Musk to mend their fractured relationship. A senior White House official confirmed that Trump is even contemplating selling or giving away his Tesla, further signaling the depth of this rift and its potential impact on the latest in US political dynamics.

**Conclusion: A Turning Point in Political Alliances**

The escalating feud between Trump and Musk serves as a reminder of the volatile nature of political alliances in today’s landscape. As both figures navigate their respective paths, the implications of this conflict extend beyond personal grievances, touching on broader themes of democracy, technology, and the future of political campaigns. As we continue to monitor this developing story, one thing is clear: the intersection of politics and technology remains a critical arena for public discourse and engagement. Stay tuned for more breaking political news and analysis as this story unfolds, reflecting the latest trends in the ever-evolving landscape of political news.
