    "optimized_text": "üö® **Breaking Political News!** üö® \n\nThe drama between President Trump and billionaire Elon Musk just hit a boiling point! üî• On Thursday, the two titans of politics and technology exchanged some serious insults, shaking up a relationship that has shaped modern American politics. \n\nIt all kicked off when Musk criticized Trump‚Äôs massive tax and spending bill, which includes cuts to electric-vehicle tax credits. In response, Trump didn‚Äôt hold back, accusing Musk of suffering from ‚ÄúTrump derangement syndrome‚Äù and even threatening to pull government contracts from his businesses! üò≤\n\nMusk, who played a crucial role in getting Trump elected, fired back, claiming the president is ungrateful and suggesting that Trump should be impeached! He even hinted at starting a third political party! üöÄ But that‚Äôs not all‚ÄîMusk made waves by mentioning Trump‚Äôs name in connection with the infamous Jeffrey Epstein files. What do you think about that? ü§î\n\nThe fallout has been significant, with Tesla's stock plummeting 14%‚Äîa staggering loss of about $152.4 billion in market value! üìâ But it seems the market is bouncing back, with shares rising 4% in premarket trading on Friday.\n\nSo, where do we go from here? A senior White House official revealed that Trump has no plans to reach out to Musk. In fact, he‚Äôs even considering selling or giving away his Tesla! \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this escalating feud? Will it impact the upcoming campaign? Let us know in the comments! üí¨üëá \n\nStay tuned for more updates on this unfolding story!",

      "discovery_results": "Okay, I will search for active and relevant Facebook accounts/usernames based on your content analysis and requirements. I will use the provided keywords, hashtags, and search queries to identify potential accounts and then filter them based on activity, engagement, follower count, and relevance.\n\nI have gathered information from the search results. Here are some potential Facebook accounts based on your criteria. Please note that due to the limitations of the search and the dynamic nature of social media, I cannot guarantee the activity level or exact follower counts. You will need to verify these details directly on Facebook.\n\n**FOUND FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS:**\n\n**üè¢ ORGANIZATIONS/COMPANIES:**\n\n*   **NASA:** ([https://www.facebook.com/NASAInSight](https://www.facebook.com/NASAInSight), [https://www.facebook.com/NASAPersevere](https://www.facebook.com/NASAPersevere), and ISS Facebook accounts mentioned in search results) - Official Facebook pages for NASA missions and the International Space Station. These pages share updates on space exploration, science, and related news.\n*   **SpaceX:** While SpaceX doesn't have an official Facebook *page* (Elon Musk deleted the official accounts some time ago), there are numerous *groups* dedicated to SpaceX and its activities. Search for \"SpaceX enthusiasts\" or similar terms to find active groups.\n*   **Tesla:** Similar to SpaceX, it's best to look for Tesla *groups* rather than a single official page. Search for \"Tesla Owners Club,\" \"Tesla enthusiasts,\" etc.\n*   **Media Outlets (General):** Many news organizations have Facebook pages. Examples from the search results include:\n    *   KAKE News\n    *   Fox News\n    *   ABC News\n    *   Daily Mail\n\n**üë§ INDIVIDUAL PROFESSIONALS:**\n\n*   It's difficult to identify specific individual professionals without more targeted searching within Facebook itself. However, you can try searching for political commentators, financial analysts, EV experts, and space exploration experts directly on Facebook. Look for profiles with a substantial number of followers and recent activity.\n*   **Tip:** Look for individuals who are speakers at relevant conferences (e.g., space conferences) and see if they have a public Facebook profile.\n\n**üì∞ MEDIA/NEWS ACCOUNTS:**\n\n*   **General News Outlets:** Most major news organizations have active Facebook pages. Examples:\n    *   CNN\n    *   The New York Times\n    *   The Washington Post\n    *   Local news outlets in the United States (search for \"[city name] news\" on Facebook)\n*   **Industry-Specific News:**\n    *   Look for media outlets that focus on automotive, space, or finance.\n\n**üéì EDUCATIONAL/ACADEMIC:**\n\n*   **Universities with Space Programs:** Search for the Facebook pages of universities with strong aerospace engineering or space science programs.\n*   **Science Museums and Planetariums:** Many museums have Facebook pages where they share educational content and promote events.\n\n**Platform-Specific Notes:**\n\n*   **Facebook Groups:** As mentioned above, Facebook groups can be a great way to find targeted discussions and engaged users. Join relevant groups to participate in conversations and identify key individuals and organizations.\n*   **Facebook Search Filters:** Use Facebook's search filters to narrow down results by post type, date posted, and location. This can help you find the most active and relevant accounts.\n*   **CrowdTangle:** CrowdTangle is a tool that helps you track social media engagement. While it's being sunsetted, you may still be able to find some useful data before it's fully retired.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n*   **Hashtag Searches:** Search for the hashtags you provided (#TrumpVsMusk, #Tesla, #SpaceX, #Megabill, #JeffreyEpstein) to find relevant content and accounts.\n*   **Keyword Searches:** Use the keywords you provided (Trump, Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, Tax Credits, Megabill, Jeffrey Epstein) to find relevant accounts and content.\n*   **Check for Verification:** Look for the blue checkmark to identify verified accounts of notable individuals and organizations. However, keep in mind that not all relevant accounts will be verified.\n*   **Manual Review:** Be prepared to manually review the accounts you find to assess their relevance, activity level, and engagement.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nPlease remember that social media content is constantly changing. The information provided here is based on the search results available at the time of this query and may not be completely up-to-date. Always verify the information directly on Facebook.\n",
