This breaking political news comes as the public exchange of insults on Thursday raises questions about the future of their once-strong alliance.\n\n**What Sparked the Feud?**\n\nThe tension escalated following Musk's vocal criticism of Trump's recent tax and spending megabill, which includes a rollback of electric-vehicle tax creditsâ€”a move that directly impacts Musk's business interests in the technology sector, particularly at @tesla. This conflict highlights the intersection of politics and business, a recurring theme in the latest in US political news.\n\nTrump responded by accusing Musk of suffering from \"Trump derangement syndrome,\" asserting that Musk's opposition stems from self-interest rather than a commitment to the American people. He even hinted at the possibility of cutting government subsidies and contracts that benefit Musk's ventures, including @spacex, a move that could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry.\n\nOn the flip side, Musk, who played a pivotal role in Trump's election campaign, expressed his disappointment, claiming that Trump would not be in the Oval Office without his support. In a bold move, Musk suggested the formation of a third political party and echoed sentiments that Trump should face impeachment, further complicating the political landscape.\n\n**The Fallout: Stock Market Reactions and Political Implications**\n\nThe fallout from this public feud has been significant. Tesla's stock experienced a dramatic 14% drop on Thursday, erasing approximately $152.4 billion in market valueâ€”the largest single-day decline in its history. However, shares rebounded slightly with a 4% increase in premarket trading on Friday, illustrating the market's sensitivity to political developments.\n\nAs the political landscape shifts, reactions from various stakeholdersâ€”including Democrats, Steve Bannon, and the broader social media communityâ€”have flooded in, highlighting the contentious nature of this feud. This situation serves as a case study in the trends and analysis of how political conflicts can ripple through the economy.\n\n**Where Do We Go From Here?**\n\nAs of now, Trump has no intention of reconciling with Musk, according to senior White House sources. The president is even contemplating selling or giving away his Tesla, a move that underscores the depth of this rift and its implications for democracy and political alliances in America.\n\n**Insights and Takeaways:**\n\n1. \n\n#election #usa #tech #trump #news",
