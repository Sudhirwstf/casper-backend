# Live Updates: The Escalating Feud Between Trump and Elon Musk

**A Rift in American Politics**

In a dramatic turn of events, the relationship between former President Donald Trump and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has taken a sharp downturn, culminating in a public exchange of insults that has captivated the nation. This feud, which erupted on June 6, 2025, marks a significant moment in modern American politics, as these two influential figures have previously shared a complex alliance. The latest in U.S. political news highlights how personal rivalries can reshape the landscape of democracy.

## The Catalyst: Musk's Criticism of Trump's Megabill

The discord began with Musk's vocal disapproval of Trump's ambitious tax and spending megabill, which aims to reshape the economic landscape. Musk's criticism was particularly pointed regarding the rollback of electric-vehicle tax credits, a move that directly impacts his automotive company, Tesla. This clash underscores the intersection of technology and politics, revealing how policy decisions can have far-reaching implications for both industries.

### Trump's Response: Accusations and Threats

In response to Musk's comments, Trump did not hold back. He accused Musk of suffering from “Trump derangement syndrome,” suggesting that the billionaire's opposition was rooted in personal animosity rather than policy disagreement. Trump further threatened to cut government subsidies and contracts that benefit Musk's businesses, signaling a potential shift in their previously symbiotic relationship. This exchange is a prime example of breaking political news that showcases the volatility of alliances in the current political climate.

## Musk's Retort: A Call for Political Change

Musk, who invested hundreds of millions to support Trump's rise to power, expressed his disappointment, labeling the president as ungrateful @tesla. He suggested that Trump would not be in the Oval Office without his backing. In a surprising twist, Musk floated the idea of launching a third political party, indicating a willingness to break from traditional political alignments. He also echoed sentiments on social media that Trump should face impeachment, further escalating tensions and reflecting the current trends in political discourse.

### SpaceX and the Stakes

In a bold move, Musk threatened to decommission SpaceX’s Dragon vehicle, a critical asset for NASA's missions to the International Space Station. However, he later retracted this statement, perhaps recognizing the implications of jeopardizing such a vital partnership. Additionally, Musk insinuated that Trump’s name appeared in files related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, suggesting a connection that has yet to be substantiated. This aspect of the feud adds another layer to the ongoing analysis of political figures and their entanglements.

## Reactions from the Political Sphere

The fallout from this feud has not gone unnoticed. Political commentators, Democrats, and even former Trump advisor Steve Bannon have weighed in, analyzing the implications of this rift on both the political landscape and Musk's business ventures. The reactions highlight how intertwined technology and politics have become, especially in the context of campaign financing and influence.

### The Impact on Tesla's Stock

The immediate financial repercussions of this feud were stark @spacex. Tesla's stock plummeted by 14% on Thursday, erasing approximately $152.4 billion in market value—the largest single-day drop in the company's history. However, a slight recovery was noted with a 4% rise in premarket trading on Friday, indicating that investors are closely monitoring the situation. This volatility serves as a reminder of how political events can impact market trends and investor confidence.

## Where Do We Go From Here?

As this public spat continues to unfold, it remains uncertain how it will affect both Trump and Musk in the long run. A senior White House official confirmed that Trump has no intention of reaching out to Musk to mend fences, and reports suggest that the former president is contemplating selling or giving away his Tesla vehicle. This ongoing saga raises questions about the future of political alliances and the role of influential figures in shaping democracy.

### Conclusion: A New Chapter in Political Alliances

The escalating feud between Trump and Musk serves as a reminder of the volatile nature of political alliances in America. As both figures navigate their respective paths, the implications of their fallout will likely reverberate through the realms of politics and technology. This situation not only highlights the fragility of relationships in the political arena but also raises critical questions about the future of campaign financing and the influence of technology on democracy.
